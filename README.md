* It was 10-Projects at the time I got the course. In the current iteration it seems that there is 2 new projects Project#11 Recipe Book and Project#12 Albumz. I will try to find them and add them to the repo.

* To run the projects npm and node are a must. there is different database technologies used through out the course so you have to figure them out.
